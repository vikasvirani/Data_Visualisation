**Objective**

Objective of the original data visualisation is to show how rapidly total deaths due to COVID-19 are increasing after the confirmed deaths are recorded 0.1 per million population in each country for each region and the targetted audience of the visualization is general public who are experiencing this pandemic.

As can be seen, line chart shows number of deaths(y-axis) in each country since the day of confirmed death(x-axis) for every region which shows hoew rapidly these caes are increasing.

The visualisation chosen had the following three main issues:

* Visual bombardment -> There is simply too much information/data points provided in one plot that it is not easy for audience to process it all by having a look at it, which decreases the intuitiveness of actual overall objective of visualisation. It can be faceted by continents instead to make it more comprehendable.

* Perceptual issues -> Use of color scheme is not intuitive, all countries within same region/continent are assigned same color, which makes it hard to distinguish between countries for a random observation in visualisation. By faceting different continents, each contry in a particular continent can be than assigned to different colors with legends to differentiate it from other countries.  

* Use of line chart is correct for a time series data, but each country having different population would not have a same number of increase in deaths as other countries within same timeframe. So, in a way, it is decieving to compare raw counts of death in each counties, instead death counts per million population of county should be considered for understanding better increase rate. Though y-axis does not have equal increase per unit, i.e 1 unit which changes from 100 to 1000 cases, in the next unit, it goes from 1000 to 10,000 cases, it is important as per objetive to identify death increase rate instead of raw counts as it is scaled to 10 times.  Similarly, x-axis doesn't have any exact date information, As it tends to show the increase in deaths after 0.1 confimed deaths per million population are recorded in each country, it is a valid x and y axis for the objetive & hence we won't change it.

#### Reconstruction

The following plot fixes the main issues in the original. (With different X-axis values for continents)

```{r fig.align="center", fig.height = 18, fig.width = 11, echo = FALSE}
